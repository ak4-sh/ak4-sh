I build tools for people who hate slow software.

Most of my time goes into developer tooling, language internals, and systems that move large amounts of data without falling over.

## Currently obsessed with
- Writing a Python LSP from scratch in Go  
- Making tooling feel instant instead of “eventually consistent”  
- Parsers, compilers, and anything that smells like a state machine  
- Caching systems that actually respect physics

## What you’ll find here
- Experiments in language servers and static analysis  
- Distributed systems prototypes  
- Fast data processing ideas  
- Occasional over-engineered side projects

## Beliefs
- Performance is a feature  
- Simple beats clever  
- Fewer dependencies, better sleep  
- Good tooling is invisible

## Stack
Go • Python • Systems • Dev Tools
